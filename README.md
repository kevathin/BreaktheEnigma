# BreaktheEnigma
a collaborative game where your goal is to break the enigma

The main reason I created this is to mainly learn more about cybersecurity. 
and its history. While learning this, I also wanted to use the knowledge that 
I have been learning over the semester. This will be during the hackathon.
where I have gone with the game design topic of collaboration. The result
of all three is a collaborative game where you and/or your team are to develop
the decryption software using a preexisting software, the machine, and some
old decrypted messages. 

The backend software will include classes that will represent either the mirror 
or the rotators themselves. 

Since the math for the plugboard is in the hundreds of trillions, 
I have made it so that the decryption software has it limited to 1 plug
and the rotators all have the same disk with a-z order. This is to prevent
the silence as it would take this laptop probably hours to compute these 
possibilities.

The possible combination of plugs will be 325 possibilities, and the possible 
The combination of rotators will be 17576, where the combined possibilities are
5,712,200. Now thinking about it, I think I am going to have to just have it 
so that either they get the idea for the solution down or have the example
The decrypter should be really close to the starting decryption software.
