            <h1>
                Break the Enigma
            </h1>

            <p>
                This is a puzzle/educational game revolving around the World War 2 germen Enigma machine. 
                This machine was used to encrypt and decrypt military messages using a mechanical box that
                would turn any inputed letter into a encrypted letter. It is you and your teams job to
                understand the inner workings of the box and using old decrypted messages to help fix the 
                algorith that another team developed.
