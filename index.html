                Break the Enigma
            </h1>

            <p>
                This is a puzzle/educational game revolving around the World War 2 germen Enigma machine. 
                This machine was used to encrypt and decrypt military messages using a mechanical box that
                would turn any inputed letter into a encrypted letter. It is you and your teams job to
                understand the inner workings of the box and using old decrypted messages to help fix the 
                algorith that another team developed.

                What is the Enigma Machine?
            </h2>

            <p>
                One of the taskforce teams has been able to recover one of their enigma machines, HURRAY!
                After studying the machine you are able to seperate the machine into 4 main parts:
                <ul>
                    <li><dt>Roters:</dt><dd>This using a series of gears and a reflector will encrypt the message</dd></li>
                    <li><dt>Display Board:</dt><dd>A display of characters where when a letter is pressed. a corresponding letter will glow</dd></li>
                    <li><dt>Keyboard:</dt><dd>A keyBoard that contains all the letters of the alphabet</dd></li>
                    <li><dt>Plugboard:</dt><dd>contains 26 plugs representing each letter where you can connect 2 Plugs together</dd></li>
                </ul>
            </p>
